Title: Crime pattern detection using historic data

Abstract:
Jewel Theft murder has become a serious issue in today’s society as crime rates are increasing rapidly. Police Officials find it difficult to identify things that can accurately and efficiently analyse the growing volume of data due to longer duration of investigation process. Our main aim is to analyse the jewel theft murder occurred over the years 2014-2019 and find crime patterns to reduce the further occurrence. The outcome of our project is to predict the jewel theft murder at a much faster rate and thus reduces the crime rate.

Datasets:
The Crime dataset contains a summary of the reported crimes occurred from 2014 to 2019 and we are going to make a predictive analysis of Jewels theft murder and forecast its crime rate in future.  

Datasets contains the following columns:
•	Id-unique identifier for the record
•	Case number-record division number
•	Date-date when the incident occurred
•	Type-crime type
•	Location description - description of the location where the incident occurred
•	Arrest-indicates whether the arrest was made
•	District-indicates the district where the incident occurred
•	Ward-the ward where the incident occurred
•	Community area-indicates the community area where the incident occurred
•	X coordinate-x coordinate of the location where the incident occurred
•	Y coordinate-y coordinate of the location where the incident occurred
•	Year-year of the incidences occurred
•	Updated on-date and time the where the record was last updated
•	Latitude-the latitude of the location where the incident occurred
•	Longitude-the longitude of the location where the incident occurred
•	Location-the location where the incident occurred in a format that allows for creation of map and other geographic operations

Description:
Crime data is collected from various sources like Kaggle, Data.gov.in which is in csv format.
The Crime data is then cleaned and unwanted data has been removed.
Crime types and location descriptions are grouped and then plotted in the form of graph.
Forecasting Jewel theft and murder crime rate:
•	Split the data into training data and testing data
•	Model creation
•	Build the model based on the training data
•	Model fitting
•	Making future prediction
•	Obtaining the forecast
•	Plotting the forecast
•	Plotting the forecast component
•	Use the model to forecast for the test data period
•	Find the trend change point
•	Visualizing the trend change

List of modules:
1.	Crime type and location description.
2.	Jewel theft and murder crime count per year.
3.	Forecasting.
4.	Forecasting components.
5.	Trend change points.

Module 1 – Crime type and location description:
Figure 1 represents the type of crimes occurred over the years 2014 – 2019. We can see that jewel theft and murder has the highest crime rate compared to other crimes, followed by road accident. Since jewel theft murder has the highest value, we are going to make a predictive analysis of it and forecast its crime rate for 2020 and 2021.
The bar graph Figure 2 represents the location description of the places where the crime had occurred over the period of years 2014 – 2019. It shows that residence is the place where the most number of crime have occurred. Street is the second most place where the crime had occurred, followed by apartment and sidewalk where the crime rates gradually decreases.

Module 2 – Jewel theft and murder crime count per year:	              
Module 2 graph Figure 3 explains the jewel theft and murder crime count per year. 2018 is the year where the least number of jewel theft and murder crimes have occurred and 2019 is the year where the maximum number of jewel theft murder crimes have occurred. The crime rate has been moderate for the years 2015, 2016 and 2017.

Module 3 - Forecasting:
Figure 4 represents the prediction for the years 2014 – 2019 and also forecast for the future years of 2020 and 2021. The black dotted line represents the actual value and the blue line represents the predicted values. 
               
Module 4 – Forecast Components:
Figure 5 represents the forecast for year wise, week wise, month wise. The first graph shows the trend for the years 2014 – 2021. The second graph shows the week wise analysis of the forecast. Tuesday and Thursday are the two days in the week where the least number of jewel theft murder crime might occur. There might be a hike in crime rate for the days Friday and Saturday. The third graph represents the forecast for month wise. The crime rates will be low in the starting month of May and there might be increase in the end of the June month.

Module 5 – Trend Changepoints:
The Figure 6 represents the prediction for Jewels theft and murder crime for the year 2014 to 2019 and made a future prediction for the years 2020 and 2021. The black dotted lines represent the actual values and blue lines represent the predicted values. The red line represents the trend changepoint at which the rate is allowed to change.

Result of predictive analysis:
•	From the above forecast, we can see that jewel theft and murder crime rate is expected to rise in the mid of 2020 and 2021 and there will be times where crime rate will be low as well. 
•	We can see that our predicted values quite matches with actual values, hence our model will prove efficient for foreseeing the future.
•	This model will help the police officials in the investigation process and gives a predictive analysis of the crime rate for future.
•	Our work aims to solve the problem at a much faster rate and thus reduces the crime rate.
